##Index

An index is used to speed up search in the database. It is essential to performance, but not functionally necessary. 
It does this by reducing the number of database data pages that have to be visited/scanned. 

### Performance Issue for Insert, Delete and Update Indexes

Insert an index is little cost; while delete an index takes some time; and update an index actually combines an delete and insert operation.
